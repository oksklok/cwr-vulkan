# Vulkan backend foundation

`PoseidonVK` is an opt-in SDL3 Vulkan backend registered as `vk`. GL33 remains
the default and reference game renderer. This stage can clear and present a
window; it cannot render game content.

## Build and selection

Configure the normal Windows Clang preset with `-DCWR_HAS_VULKAN=ON` and an
installed/system Vulkan SDK. CMake uses `find_package(Vulkan REQUIRED)` and
`Vulkan::Vulkan`; no Vulkan dependency framework is vendored. The option defaults
to OFF, so normal GL33 builds do not require or link Vulkan.

```powershell
cmake --preset win-x64-clang-rwdi -DCWR_HAS_VULKAN=ON
cmake --build build/win-x64-clang-rwdi --target PoseidonVK PoseidonGL33 PoseidonTests PoseidonVKPolicyTests PoseidonGame
ctest --test-dir build/win-x64-clang-rwdi -R '^PoseidonVKPolicyTests$' --output-on-failure
```

The game clients (Game, GameDemo and Tetris) explicitly register the backend
when enabled. The existing `--render` option accepts `vk`; its default remains
`gl33`. Registration does not initialize SDL or enumerate physical devices.
Factory availability means the backend was compiled/registered, not that a
compatible driver has been verified. Creation reports errors and returns null.
Vulkan has lower factory priority than Dummy, so automatic selection preserves
the existing GL33-to-Dummy fallback instead of selecting an unfinished renderer.

Do not launch the game to verify this milestone. Selecting `vk` during normal
game startup will encounter explicitly unsupported content-rendering calls.

## Ownership and frame lifecycle

- `EngineVK` inherits the existing `Engine` directly and implements its window,
  frame and capability seams. It owns an SDL Vulkan window and balances its
  video-subsystem reference. It uses the existing window placement resolver and
  the shared SDL input/focus/fullscreen event pump.
- `VulkanContext` is private to this backend. It owns the instance, SDL-created
  surface, selected device, queues, command pool and all swapchain/frame objects.
  It needs Vulkan headers and the loader, but no engine, SDL or asset types.
- `SwapchainPolicy.hpp` contains only driver-free surface/queue decisions.
- `EngineVK_Unsupported.cpp` centralizes explicit failures for unfinished
  resource and rendering entry points. It does not inherit Dummy's no-op draws.

Instance creation uses SDL's required surface extensions, optional debug-utils
object names and optional portability enumeration. No validation layer is
required or enabled implicitly. A Vulkan 1.0 device is sufficient; portability
subset is enabled when the selected device advertises it.

Device selection requires graphics and presentation queues, the swapchain
extension, usable surface formats/present modes, and color-attachment image
usage. Discrete GPUs are preferred over integrated GPUs. A combined graphics
and present family is preferred; distinct families use concurrent image sharing.

Swapchain creation chooses a supported format, clamped/fixed surface extent,
bounded image count and supported composite-alpha mode. FIFO is the default;
requested off/adaptive intervals use supported alternatives with FIFO fallback.
Each image has a view, clear-pass framebuffer and presentation semaphore.

Two frames in flight each have a command buffer, acquire semaphore and initially
signaled submit fence. `InitDraw` checks SDL's drawable size, skips minimized or
zero-sized windows, recreates when needed, waits for the frame fence and acquires
an image with a finite timeout. Out-of-date acquire defers recreation without
resetting the fence. Suboptimal acquire is consumed and presented before rebuild.

The render pass transitions an undefined image into color-attachment use and
finally into presentation layout. Every frame begins with opaque black;
`Clear` records a full color clear using the engine's packed RGB convention.
There is no retained framebuffer-content contract or depth attachment yet.
`clearZ` has no effect because no depth image exists.

`FinishDraw` closes and submits the command buffer, then presents. The submit
waits at color-attachment output. Fences reset only immediately before submit.
Present-wait semaphores are indexed by acquired image rather than frame index,
as described in the [Khronos semaphore reuse guide](https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/swapchain_semaphore_reuse.html).
Out-of-date/suboptimal present requests recreation. Other Vulkan errors stop
the backend and release resources; failed recording/submission is not retried
with potentially stranded synchronization objects.

Resize and fullscreen/pixel-size events request deferred recreation. Recreation
waits for device idle, destroys the old image resources, and rebuilds from fresh
surface capabilities. Minimized windows retain old resources until drawable.
Shutdown waits idle, destroys framebuffers/render pass/views/semaphores and the
swapchain, then frame synchronization, command pool, device, surface, instance,
SDL window and the backend's SDL video reference. Partial initialization cleanup
and repeated shutdown are supported. This uses the conventional core-Vulkan
idle-based swapchain teardown; presentation fences/maintenance extensions and
non-blocking swapchain retirement are outside this stage.

The shared `SDLEventWindow.hpp` moved from PoseidonGL33 to
`Poseidon/Graphics/Shared`, retaining its existing behavior and adding drawable
pixel-size events for DPI changes. The existing source-audit test follows the move.
Vulkan uses SDL's fullscreen path and does not initialize the GL ImGui renderer.

## Deliberately unsupported

No graphics pipeline, shader, vertex/index upload, draw emission, 2D/UI/font
rendering, texture bank/loading/upload, material binding, mesh/TL path, depth
buffer, depth bias, gamma correction or shadow rendering is implemented.
Required draw/resource methods throw an actionable `std::logic_error`; neutral
gamma/bias requests are allowed, and unsupported capabilities report false.
Optional engine features otherwise retain the base interface's unsupported
defaults. Monitor enumeration and SDL display-mode requests are implemented;
monitor switching and readback are not.

No GL33 renderer replacement, assets, localization, modern shading, upscaling or
renderer redesign is part of this change.

## Verification

`PoseidonVKPolicyTests` exercises queue selection, extent/image-count bounds,
format/present/composite-alpha fallback, recreation classification and empty
context/invalid-initialization guards. Its 37 checks make no Vulkan API call,
create no instance or SDL window, and enumerate no physical devices. It links
the loader only to compile/link the real lifecycle implementation.

The existing Catch2 graphics/factory tests also test actual backend registration,
priority, idempotence, enum/code lookup and unavailable-backend handling. Those
tests use sentinel creation callbacks and never construct a Vulkan engine.

Verification on Windows used the installed Vulkan SDK 1.4.350.0, MSVC 14.44,
and worktree-local LLVM 21.1.8, CMake 4.4.4, Ninja 1.13.2 and vcpkg. The latter
tools and the unchanged manifest dependencies were installed under ignored
`build/tools` after dependency installation was authorized; nothing is vendored
into the backend. There is no remaining dependency blocker for this build.

- With Vulkan ON: PoseidonVK, PoseidonGL33 (and Dummy in Poseidon), all three
  client executables and all seven unit-test executables built and linked.
- With Vulkan OFF: GL33/Dummy, all three clients and all seven unit-test
  executables built and linked. Import inspection confirms that the GL33-only
  game executable does not import `vulkan-1.dll`; the Vulkan-enabled one does.
- Driver-free policy CTest: 1/1 passed, all 37 checks. The context and tests also
  compiled with MSVC `/W4 /WX`, and for x86 as objects only.
- Graphics/factory/input selection: 348 test cases passed with Vulkan ON and
  OFF. Hidden fixture-generation tests are excluded from this selection. The
  registration test uses real Dummy/Vulkan descriptors, but models GL33 with a
  sentinel because this harness stubs its registration. It also checks that the
  CLI default is still `gl33` and the existing Auto enum value is unchanged.
- Broader suites (excluding external game-data tags): Core 812/812 and
  Foundation 475/475 passed in both configurations. Poseidon 2450/2451 passed
  in both; the unchanged `ModArchive::Unpack rejects a valid archive wrapping a
  corrupt PBO` test throws `No mapping for the Unicode character exists in the
  target multi-byte code page.` No unrelated archive/encoding fix is included.
  Foundation's intentional crash-handler child test emits a diagnostic dump;
  the parent suite passes.
- Vulkan-enabled application suites: Server 7/7, Evaluator 95/95, Tetris 9/9,
  headless software-rendered Studio 50/50 passed.
- New C++ files pass clang-format checks; `git diff --check` passes.

Legacy tests using absolute `/tmp` paths ran through a temporary drive alias
rooted in this worktree's ignored build directory; user/cache/temp directories
were also redirected there. No game executable was launched and no Vulkan
instance, physical device or live clear/present frame was tested. Before/after
file-count/size/timestamp snapshots of `game-local/Remastered`, localization and
resources are identical. Physical driver behavior remains deliberately unverified.

The next renderer milestone is one untextured triangle through the existing
engine draw seams, preceded by live validation of this clear/present lifecycle,
including resize, minimize/restore and fullscreen transitions. It is not started
in this change.
