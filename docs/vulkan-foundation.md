# Vulkan backend development

`PoseidonVK` is an opt-in SDL3 Vulkan backend registered as `vk`. GL33 remains
the default and reference game renderer. Clear/present and an opt-in indexed
triangle diagnostic work; normal game-content rendering remains unsupported.

## Build and selection

Configure the normal Windows Clang preset with `-DCWR_HAS_VULKAN=ON` and an
installed/system Vulkan SDK. CMake uses `find_package(Vulkan REQUIRED)` and
`Vulkan::Vulkan`; no Vulkan dependency framework is vendored. The option defaults
to OFF, so normal GL33 builds do not require or link Vulkan. The indexed triangle
also requires the SDK's `glslangValidator`: CMake compiles the two GLSL sources to
embedded SPIR-V 1.0 at build time (no runtime shader compiler). SDL3's `vulkan`
vcpkg feature must be enabled; its Windows default otherwise rejects Vulkan windows.

```powershell
cmake --preset win-x64-clang-rwdi -DCWR_HAS_VULKAN=ON
cmake --build build/win-x64-clang-rwdi --target PoseidonVK PoseidonGL33 PoseidonTests PoseidonVKPolicyTests PoseidonGame
ctest --test-dir build/win-x64-clang-rwdi -R '^PoseidonVKPolicyTests$' --output-on-failure
```

The game clients (Game, GameDemo and Tetris) explicitly register the backend
when enabled. The existing `--render` option accepts `vk`; its default remains
`gl33`. Registration does not initialize SDL or enumerate physical devices.
Factory availability means the backend was compiled/registered, not that a
compatible driver has been verified. Creation reports errors and returns null.
Vulkan has lower factory priority than Dummy, so automatic selection preserves
the existing GL33-to-Dummy fallback instead of selecting an unfinished renderer.

Use the explicit renderer-only smoke mode for live testing:

```powershell
PoseidonGame.exe -C <GOG-Remastered-3.05-directory> --render vk --vulkan-smoke triangle --vk-validation --width 800 --height 600 --timeout 30
```

`--vulkan-smoke clear` tests the original clear/present path. Both modes use the
existing backend factory and SDL window/event loop, stop before game-content and
audio initialization, never fall back to GL33, and exercise normal destruction
on timeout or window close. A disabled Vulkan build rejects the option. Normal
game startup with `--render vk` still encounters explicit unsupported calls.
Use the existing `POSEIDON_USER_DIR`, `POSEIDON_CACHE_DIR` and `POSEIDON_TEMP_DIR`
redirects to keep test writes outside the retail content directory.

## Ownership and frame lifecycle

- `EngineVK` inherits the existing `Engine` directly and implements its window,
  frame and capability seams. It owns an SDL Vulkan window and balances its
  video-subsystem reference. It uses the existing window placement resolver and
  the shared SDL input/focus/fullscreen event pump.
- `VulkanContext` is private to this backend. It owns the instance, SDL-created
  surface, selected device, queues, command pool and all swapchain/frame objects.
  It needs Vulkan headers and the loader, but no engine, SDL or asset types.
- `SwapchainPolicy.hpp` contains only driver-free surface/queue decisions.
- `EngineVK_Unsupported.cpp` centralizes explicit failures for unfinished
  resource and rendering entry points. It does not inherit Dummy's no-op draws.

Instance creation uses SDL's required surface extensions, optional debug-utils
object names and optional portability enumeration. `--vk-validation` requires the
Khronos validation layer; its absence fails initialization with an actionable
error, rather than allowing an unvalidated smoke-test success. Synchronization
validation is enabled when its layer extension is available. Warning/error callbacks
include their message IDs. Loader diagnostics are distinguished from validation
messages. A Vulkan 1.0 device is sufficient; portability subset is enabled when
advertised, with its properties2 instance dependency retained.

Device selection requires graphics and presentation queues, the swapchain
extension, usable surface formats/present modes, and color-attachment image
usage. Discrete GPUs are preferred over integrated GPUs. A combined graphics
and present family is preferred; distinct families use concurrent image sharing.

Swapchain creation chooses a supported format, clamped/fixed surface extent,
bounded image count and supported composite-alpha mode. FIFO is the default;
requested off/adaptive intervals use supported alternatives with FIFO fallback.
Each image has a view, clear-pass framebuffer and presentation semaphore.

Two frames in flight each have a command buffer, acquire semaphore and initially
signaled submit fence. `InitDraw` checks SDL's drawable size, skips minimized or
zero-sized windows, recreates when needed, waits for the frame fence and acquires
an image with a finite timeout. Out-of-date acquire defers recreation without
resetting the fence. Suboptimal acquire is consumed and presented before rebuild.

The render pass transitions an undefined image into color-attachment use and
finally into presentation layout. Every frame begins with opaque black;
`Clear` records a full color clear using the engine's packed RGB convention.
There is no retained framebuffer-content contract or depth attachment yet.
`clearZ` has no effect because no depth image exists.

`FinishDraw` closes and submits the command buffer, then presents. The submit
waits at color-attachment output. Fences reset only immediately before submit.
Present-wait semaphores are indexed by acquired image rather than frame index,
as described in the [Khronos semaphore reuse guide](https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/swapchain_semaphore_reuse.html).
Out-of-date/suboptimal present requests recreation. Other Vulkan errors stop
the backend and release resources; failed recording/submission is not retried
with potentially stranded synchronization objects.

Resize and fullscreen/pixel-size events request deferred recreation. Recreation
waits for device idle, destroys the old image resources, and rebuilds from fresh
surface capabilities. Minimized windows retain old resources until drawable.
Shutdown waits idle, destroys the triangle pipeline before the render pass,
then framebuffers/views/semaphores and swapchain, immutable geometry buffers,
pipeline layout, frame synchronization, command pool, device, surface, instance,
SDL window and the backend's SDL video reference. Partial initialization cleanup
and repeated shutdown are supported. This uses the conventional core-Vulkan
idle-based swapchain teardown; presentation fences/maintenance extensions and
non-blocking swapchain retirement are outside this stage.

The shared `SDLEventWindow.hpp` moved from PoseidonGL33 to
`Poseidon/Graphics/Shared`, retaining its existing behavior and adding drawable
pixel-size events for DPI changes. The existing source-audit test follows the move.
Vulkan uses SDL's fullscreen path and does not initialize the GL ImGui renderer.

## Deliberately unsupported

Only the diagnostic triangle has a pipeline, shaders and vertex/index upload.
Normal geometry submission, 2D/UI/font rendering, texture bank/loading/upload,
material binding, mesh/TL path, depth
buffer, depth bias, gamma correction or shadow rendering is implemented.
Required draw/resource methods throw an actionable `std::logic_error`; neutral
gamma/bias requests are allowed, and unsupported capabilities report false.
Optional engine features otherwise retain the base interface's unsupported
defaults. Monitor enumeration and SDL display-mode requests are implemented;
monitor switching and readback are not.

No GL33 renderer replacement, assets, localization, modern shading, upscaling or
renderer redesign is part of this change.

## Indexed triangle and donor reuse

`EngineVK::DrawTestPattern("triangle")` is allowed only with
`--vulkan-smoke triangle`. Three immutable position/color vertices and uint16
indices **2,0,1** are uploaded into coherent host-visible buffers, bound to a
minimal graphics pipeline and drawn with `vkCmdDrawIndexed`. Dynamic viewport,
scissor and aspect compensation follow the swapchain extent. Both frame slots
share read-only geometry; resize rebuilds the pipeline against the new render
pass, retaining buffers/layout. Device-idle teardown releases all resources.

Selectively adapted from **Deus-Ex (koosoli)**, `koosoli/PoseidonVK` commit
`7523bd5d3afcc13f13e51050d7c717ca103a7c19`: the host-visible allocation/map/unmap
pattern in `BufferVK.hpp/.cpp` and `bootstrap_triangle.vert.glsl` /
`bootstrap_triangle.frag.glsl`. These remain GPL-3.0-or-later with the additional
Bohemia terms in `LICENSE`. Buffer ownership/bounds/failure cleanup were tightened;
the shader UBO/descriptors were removed in favor of 32-byte push constants. The
pipeline, smoke loop and integration adapt to our existing context, frame slots
and per-image present synchronization; donor texture/mesh/framework code was not
incorporated. Official 3.05 renderer seams and working lifecycle code are retained.

The backend-private `BufferVK` helper accepts buffer size/usage independently of
the triangle. It is the minimal preparation for `Engine::CreateVertexBuffer` and
`DrawSectionTL`: GL33's existing `Shape` path fan-triangulates polygons and tracks
per-section index ranges. Those engine entry points still throw in Vulkan; no
fake vertex-buffer or geometry-submission implementation was added.

## Live verification (2026-10-09)

- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, driver 617.14 (Windows 32.0.16.1714), Vulkan
  1.4.351; installed SDK/Khronos validation layer 1.4.350.0. API requests remain 1.0.
- Used `PoseidonGame` against the authorized local GOG Remastered 3.05 content
  directory with user/cache/temp redirected under ignored `build/vulkan-live`.
  The renderer-only diagnostic does not claim game-world Vulkan compatibility.
- First live clear attempt exposed SDL3's missing Vulkan build feature. After
  enabling it, clear/present and resizing worked. Normal close then exposed an
  inactive progress query unnecessarily calling the unsupported texture bank;
  a guarded short-circuit fixes this shared startup/close seam, with regression test.
- Clear retest: two resize recreations, 230 submitted frames, normal shutdown,
  zero validation errors/warnings. Triangle: visibly correct at 800x600,
  1104x801 and 704x501, also after minimize/restore; 11,038 submitted frames,
  normal close exit 0, zero core/synchronization validation errors or warnings
  including resource destruction. Pipeline recreation occurred for every new
  swapchain; geometry was uploaded once.
- One external loader error remains: a stale Epic Online Services overlay JSON
  path. Implicit overlays were disabled only for the test processes; their
  disabled-layer loader warnings are not validation warnings. No machine overlay
  installation or registry was changed.
- Vulkan-enabled and GL33-only Game/GameDemo/Tetris, GL33/Dummy and the Poseidon
  test target build successfully. Driver-free policy CTest passes all **83** checks (original
  42 plus buffer allocation/map/bind failure cleanup, bounds/lifetime and indexed
  layout/draw guards). Factory: 17 cases in each configuration (ON: 94 assertions,
  OFF: 91); window/close regression: 3 cases / 10 assertions in each. No driver is
  called by these tests.
- Final rebuilt clear/triangle timeout checks both exit 0 with zero validation
  errors/warnings, including teardown. Missing explicit `--render vk` and a
  Vulkan-disabled build both reject the diagnostic with exit 1. Default GL33
  `--check --nosound` exits 0 against the same content; the existing missing
  `biscamel\icamel2.paa` warning is not changed. Import inspection confirms no
  `vulkan-1.dll` dependency in the GL33-only executable.
- Game-local content, localization and resources retain identical before/after
  file-count/size/timestamp snapshots. No assets or distribution settings changed.
  Formatting and `git diff --check` pass; no dependency blocker remains.

Local evidence: `build/vulkan-live/clear/retest.{stdout,stderr}.log` and
`build/vulkan-live/triangle/{stdout,stderr}.log`, with `initial.png`, `resized.png`
and `restored.png`. Other GPUs/platforms, normal Vulkan gameplay and non-blocking
swapchain retirement are not validated by this milestone.

Follow-up error-path fix: mapped pointers become owned only after `vkMapMemory`
succeeds. Terminal backend shutdown returns the final validation count, so the
smoke verdict includes destruction-time errors. Driver-free regressions cover a
failed map with non-null output and an injected teardown-only validation error;
both build configurations and their focused tests pass. The GPU results above
precede this follow-up; no new live run was performed for these error-path fixes.

Explicit-validation follow-up: a missing requested Khronos layer fails before
instance creation. Driver-free tests cover the rejection/error message, enabling
an available requested layer, and unchanged layer-independent operation without
the flag. CLI help now describes the strict requirement; no new live run was performed.

The smallest next step is one immutable, untextured `Shape` through the existing
`CreateVertexBuffer` / `DrawSectionTL` section/index-range seams, using these buffer
and pipeline primitives. It has not been started.

## Historical driver-free verification (initial foundation)

`PoseidonVKPolicyTests` exercises queue selection, extent/image-count bounds,
format/present/composite-alpha fallback, recreation classification and empty
context/invalid-initialization guards. Its 37 checks make no Vulkan API call,
create no instance or SDL window, and enumerate no physical devices. It links
the loader only to compile/link the real lifecycle implementation.

The existing Catch2 graphics/factory tests also test actual backend registration,
priority, idempotence, enum/code lookup and unavailable-backend handling. Those
tests use sentinel creation callbacks and never construct a Vulkan engine.

Verification on Windows used the installed Vulkan SDK 1.4.350.0, MSVC 14.44,
and worktree-local LLVM 21.1.8, CMake 4.4.4, Ninja 1.13.2 and vcpkg. The latter
tools and the unchanged manifest dependencies were installed under ignored
`build/tools` after dependency installation was authorized; nothing is vendored
into the backend. There is no remaining dependency blocker for this build.

- With Vulkan ON: PoseidonVK, PoseidonGL33 (and Dummy in Poseidon), all three
  client executables and all seven unit-test executables built and linked.
- With Vulkan OFF: GL33/Dummy, all three clients and all seven unit-test
  executables built and linked. Import inspection confirms that the GL33-only
  game executable does not import `vulkan-1.dll`; the Vulkan-enabled one does.
- Driver-free policy CTest: 1/1 passed, all 37 checks. The context and tests also
  compiled with MSVC `/W4 /WX`, and for x86 as objects only.
- Graphics/factory/input selection: 348 test cases passed with Vulkan ON and
  OFF. Hidden fixture-generation tests are excluded from this selection. The
  registration test uses real Dummy/Vulkan descriptors, but models GL33 with a
  sentinel because this harness stubs its registration. It also checks that the
  CLI default is still `gl33` and the existing Auto enum value is unchanged.
- Broader suites (excluding external game-data tags): Core 812/812 and
  Foundation 475/475 passed in both configurations. Poseidon 2450/2451 passed
  in both; the unchanged `ModArchive::Unpack rejects a valid archive wrapping a
  corrupt PBO` test throws `No mapping for the Unicode character exists in the
  target multi-byte code page.` No unrelated archive/encoding fix is included.
  Foundation's intentional crash-handler child test emits a diagnostic dump;
  the parent suite passes.
- Vulkan-enabled application suites: Server 7/7, Evaluator 95/95, Tetris 9/9,
  headless software-rendered Studio 50/50 passed.
- New C++ files pass clang-format checks; `git diff --check` passes.

At the initial foundation stage, legacy tests using absolute `/tmp` paths ran through a temporary drive alias
rooted in this worktree's ignored build directory; user/cache/temp directories
were also redirected there. No game executable was launched and no Vulkan
instance, physical device or live clear/present frame was tested. Before/after
file-count/size/timestamp snapshots of `game-local/Remastered`, localization and
resources were identical. Physical driver behavior was unverified at that stage;
the live results above supersede that limitation. These broader historical suites
were not all rerun for the indexed-triangle change.
